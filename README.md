# Big Data Weather Analysis Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive big data approach to analyzing weather data using cutting-edge technologies in distributed computing and data visualization. By leveraging Hadoop's distributed processing capabilities and MapReduce paradigm, we process and extract meaningful insights from the extensive NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) weather dataset.

## Background

Weather data analysis is crucial for understanding climate patterns, predicting environmental trends, and supporting decision-making in various sectors such as agriculture, transportation, and urban planning. The NOAA dataset provides a rich source of historical weather information, making it an ideal candidate for in-depth analysis using big data technologies.

## Project Objectives

The primary goals of this project are to:
- Efficiently process large-scale weather datasets using distributed computing
- Compute key statistical metrics across multiple weather parameters
- Visualize weather trends and patterns in an intuitive manner
- Demonstrate the power of Hadoop and MapReduce in handling big data challenges

## Technical Architecture

### Data Source
- **Dataset**: NOAA Weather Dataset
- **Size**: Potentially multiple terabytes of historical weather records
- **Parameters Analyzed**:
  - Temperature
  - Wind Speed
  - Sky Cloud Cover
  - Atmospheric Pressure

### Technology Stack
- **Distributed Computing**: Apache Hadoop
- **File System**: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
- **Processing Paradigm**: MapReduce
- **Visualization**: Power BI
- **Programming Languages**: Java (MapReduce), Python (Data Download)

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Extraction and Processing
- **Data Download**: 
  - Utilize `Weather_data_HadoopDownload.ipynb` to download the NOAA dataset
  - Perform initial data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Hadoop Integration**:
  - Load raw weather data into HDFS
  - Prepare data for distributed processing
  - Ensure data integrity and consistency

### 2. Weather Metric Computation
- **MapReduce Jobs**:
  - Develop custom mapper and reducer implementations
  - Compute statistical metrics:
    * Average values
    * Maximum values
    * Minimum values
  - Parallelize computation across Hadoop cluster
  - Handle large-scale data efficiently

### 3. Data Visualization
- **Power BI Integration**:
  - Import computed metrics
  - Create interactive dashboards
  - Generate insights through visual representations
  - Support data-driven decision making
